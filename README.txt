The production dataset may be downloaded from the website http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html under New York City, New York, United States. The datasets needed are listings.csv and calendar.csv. Both of these files should be converted to .xlsx files.

The data from listings.xlsx can be extracted and inserted into the database using the code in listingInsert.py (simply run the command 'python listingInsert.py' on the command line). The same can be done with the data from calendar.xlsx using the code in calendarInsert.py.
Note that this will not work on a computer without access to the database we are using.
